# How organized the folder structure.

### Assets Folder

Here we can store our global styles, images and fonts.

### Components

Here we can store all the reusable components, organized into subdirectories either by feature(for example, Product-Card, Cart-Item, etc.). Common subdirectories consists of a collection of UI components like buttons, modals,inputs, etc., that can be used across various files in the project.

### Layouts

It contains layouts available to the whole project like header, footer, etc.

### Lib

Here we can store shared code like API functions, types(types, interfaces and enums), and utility functions(repeatedly used functions that are commonly used in the project).

### Assets Folder

This is where we define our application's routes and pages. The components will be created in subdirectories corresponding to the URL structure(for example, Main, Cart, 404, etc).

### Files

App.ts - contain the main application component, index.ts - the entry point of the application.

**The file name is identical to the folder name**

**_The folder structure may change during the further development of the project._**
